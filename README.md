## Instructions

 **Controls:**
   - Use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to control the snake's movement (Up, Left, Down, Right).
   - Eat '@' to grow the snake and increase your score.

**Game Over:**
   - The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with itself.
   - Your final score will be displayed at the end.

**High Scores:**
   - The game keeps track of high scores.
   - Enter your name at the end of the game to save your score.
## C Language Topics

**Flow Control:**
   - The code uses flow control structures like `if`, `switch`, and loops (`while`) to manage the game's logic and control flow.

**Functions:**
   - Modular organization improves code readability, with concise `function prototype` providing a clear overview of the main function and associated functionalities.

**Arrays:**
   - Arrays are used to represent the snake's tail positions (`tailX` and `tailY`), the game board dimensions (`HEIGHT` and `WIDTH`), and positions of the fruit (`fruitX` and `fruitY`).

**Pointers:**
   - Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation to handle the snake's tail length dynamically.

**Strings:**
   - Character sequences are used for printing the game board and player's name.

**Structures:**
   - A structure (`struct Player`) is introduced to store the player's name and score, enhancing data organization.

**File Handling:**
   - The code includes file handling to save and load high scores in a file (`highscores.txt`).
